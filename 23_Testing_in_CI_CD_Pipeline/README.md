# Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

1. CI is the practice of integrating code into a shared repository and building/testing each change automatically, as early as possible - usually several times a day
2. Continous Delivery adds that the software can be relesed to production at any time, often by automatically pushing changes to a staging system
3. CI/CD Tools : Jenkins, Bamboo, cicleci, Gitlab CI, Github Actions
